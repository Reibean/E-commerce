## Installation

To install simply navigate to the root directory and run "npm i" in your command line to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

To use this application you will first need to log in to MySQL from the command line (mysql -u root -p). From there you can type "source db/schema.sql" and this will create the database. Type "quit" to go back to GitBash or whatever command line prompt you are using then run "npm run seed" to seed the database. Finally run "npm run start" to start a local server where you can use insomnia (or another program meant to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
